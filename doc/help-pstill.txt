See 'pstill-license' file for usage conditions and copyrights

Usage: pstill [options] -o output.pdf input1 input2 input3...

-F format 'letter','legal','a5','a4','a3'.'a2','a1','a0',...
          (default is 'letter', use -w # and -h # for custom page formats:)
-w #      sets the output page width in pts [612]
-h #      sets the output page height in pts [792]
-d #      sets the internal interpreter dpi accuracy [150]
          alternatively use -d #/#/#, where the first # is the placement
          accuracy, the second is the raster image dpi and the last # is the
          b/w image dpi. Images will be recalculated to lower densities
-a #      sets the output numerical accuracy (0-6) [2]
-l #      sets the minimal allowed linewidth [0.0]
-o file   sets the output file name [out.pdf]
-c        turns on flate compression (PDF 1.2 feature)
          when used as '-c -c' also turns on binary output
          when used as '-c -c -c -c' also max. out the compression level
-g        turns on get page size from job (if any)
          For EPS sources BoundingBox is used, for PS/PDF the job page setup.
          Use together with -M getPageBBox to prefer the PageBoundingBox
          DSC comments instead of the actual PS page setup commands.
-i        turns on include non-std fonts in output
-r        turns on reverse page order in output
-p        turns on include partial fonts in output
-s        turns on include standard fonts in output,
          This is a non-standard feature, use with caution
-t        turns on mapping of PS transfer function to output
-R #      rotate page in output (# must be 0,90,180 or 270 degrees)
          0 degree also turns on' %Orientation: Landscape' check for Job
-P        turn all text to paths (useful to generate font'less PDFs)
-I        install PSFonts, initialize PStills font metrics & widths cache
-T path   path to a directory where tmp files should be placed
          Attention: Each running instance needs a unique temp dir!

Output mode options to '-m' are:
-m mode   set mode to either 'p' for PS or 'e' for EPS generation,
          modes 'P' and 'E' include also fonts in the result
-m Pdirect   PostScript direct output, write PS (fast mode, single input only)
-m Prewrite  PostScript normalization, write PS (Prepress purpose)
-m Erewrite  PostScript normalization, write EPS (Prepress purpose)
-m Erewrite+ PostScript normalization, write EPS (Prepress purpose) + preview
-m Edirect   no normalization, just write EPS (Prepress purpose)
          Note: Prepress normalization is a separate license option for PStill
                and not part of the standard distribution.

More mode options to '-m' are:
-m textout           also generate TXT output, parallel to PDF
-m textoutdirect     generate only TXT output (input must be PDF!)
-m imageoutdirect    generate only JPG, PNG or TIFF output
-m info=pagenum      generate info output (source must be PDF!)
-m info=pagesize     generate info output, use -M pdfpagerange=.. to define page
-m structured        "structured" output mode, no PDF processing
-m extractAIP        "AI private" extraction mode, no PDF processing
                     source must be an Illustrator 'AI' file PDF-style.

Control options to '-m' are:
-m Xspot             turn on spot colors takeover into result
-m Xoverprint        turn on overprinting takeover into result
-m Xovptrans         turn on overprinting visible simulation in result

-m Xmono2gray        turn on image rewriting S/W to halfton 4x4
-m Xmono2gray=low    turn on image rewriting S/W to halfton 8x8
-m Xlevel1eps        EPS output (PSRW mode) will use only PS Level 1
-m XPDFA=INTENTNAME  turn on PDF/A-1b output, you can use 'RGB' as
                     INTENTNAME for some reasonable defaults.
-m XPDFACompat=#     set PDF/A-1b compat level (# = 7 - 9 for AA vers)
-m XPDFX=INTENTNAME  turn on PDF/X output (default is PDF/X-3)
-m XPDFXVERSION=1A   turn on PDF/X output Version 1a (needs XPDFX)
-m XICCProfile=file  embed also this ICC color profile (needs XPDFX/A)
-m Xusesrctransp     allows to process transparencies in PDF input
-m Xsep2comp         turn on separation to composite (needs S2C module)
                     S2C is a separate license option to PStill and not
                     part of the standard distribution.

-E pagenum set the target page for EPS generation (needs '-m e')
-C        set the output color model to RGB (default is CMYK)
-B        set the output color model to Gray (default is CMYK)
          Note: Use RGB if colors appear too dark in Reader!
-2        declare PostScript Level 2 compatibility
-J #      set JPEG compression for output, # quality is 0..100 [best]
          when defined as "#,p" output will be progressive JPEG

-S #      set logical start page number for PDF page numbering
          also accepts complex numbering schemes, see documentation

-Y        write calibrated colors (needs also option -C)
-V ".."   Open: ActionFit, HideToolbar, HideMenubar, HideWindowUI, CenterWindow
          also: PageTransition=#, where # is the effect between 0 (none) and 16

          Use this feature to submit (PDF) papers for later reprocessing
-D        Autoconvert DVIPS TeX bitmap fonts (Type1 tex fonts must be installed)
          Use this feature to make dvips generated PS input display better
-Q        Do not use a document font if the same font (by name) is installed
-N path   tell PStill where to find TTF master fonts (automatic on Win32)
-O        Do not use the BBox of an EPS input but the page setting of PStill
-k        Allow the interpreter to write to files (Warning: security risk!)
-v        turn on verbose mode

-M        Special control and security options:

Run pstill -I whenever new fonts are added to PSFonts!

To install pstill:

Set the PSTILL_PATH and (optional) PSTILL_LICENSE environment variables.
PSTILL_PATH must point to the folder containing the PStill files.

% cd ${PSTILL_PATH}/PSFonts
% cp /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/* .  (or run ../linkAllFonts.sh)
% cd ..
% ./pstill -I


For PDF image output (-m imageoutdirect) these options are used differently:
 -d # (DPI), -m XimgAsCMYK (output as CMYK for TIFF, default is RGB),
 -J ## (JPEG, default is TIFF), -m Xusesrctransp (PNG/alpha, default TIFF/JPEG)


How to use pstill (examples):

Convert with manual default settings, set page size fix to a3:
% pstill -2 -F a3 -v -c -c -c -c -g -i -p -t -o result.pdf input.ps

Convert with default settings, get page size from job:
% pstill -M default -o result.pdf input.ps

Convert with extended defaults (use e.g. for MS Windows PS jobs), get page size
from job:
% pstill -M defaultall -o result.pdf input.ps

Convert with extended defaults, keep spot colors and overprint settings, subset
fonts, JPEG:
% pstill -M defaultall -p -J 85 -m Xspot -m Xoverprint -o result.pdf input.ps

Convert to PDF/A-1b:
% pstill -M defaultall -s -p -m XPDFA=RGB -o result.pdf input.ps

Instead of PostScript you can also supply PDF, JPEG and TIFF
